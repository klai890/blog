Hi, I'm Karena, a rising high school senior! I'm interested in web development and artificial intelligence, and this is my blog. In this blog, plan on writing about the aforementioned topics.

This is my first post on this website! I learnt the basics of Next.js in five days, and I finally have my own blog site up and running! My summer plans are as follows– coding, blogging, and college applications, in no particular order. I look forward to updating this website, and we'll see where this goes!
